      <h1>GEOG 458 Final Project: COVID-19 Mapping in the U.S.</h1>
      <h4>Winter 2024, Group AB4</h4>
      <p>This storytelling map presents COVID-19 data across the United States, utilizing information sourced from the
        New York Times. The objective of this project is to analyze the varied responses of different states to the
        COVID-19 pandemic and their subsequent impact on the pandemic trends within each state. The selected states for
        in-depth examination include Washington, New York, Georgia, and Florida. Through this initiative, we aim to shed
        light on effective response strategies and preventive measures that can be adopted to mitigate the spread of
        future pandemics and safeguard lives.

      <h2>A Closer Look: Washington</h2>
      <h3> Hover over a County for more Info! </h3>
      <p>Washington State swiftly responded to the COVID-19 outbreak by implementing a comprehensive set of measures,
        particularly during the initial stages of the pandemic. As one of the earliest states to experience the
        outbreak, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency in February 2020. This declaration was followed by
        the enforcement of a Stay-at-Home Order, accompanied by the closure of non-essential businesses. Additionally,
        indoor and outdoor mask mandates were put into effect to mitigate the spread of the virus. Washington sustained
        these restrictions for an extended period until the introduction of a Phased Reopening plan, complemented by
        robust contact tracing efforts and the implementation of early vaccination mandates.</p>
      <p>Some key Washington COVID Measures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Declaration of a state of emergency and prompt implementation of a Stay-at-Home Order.</li>
        <li>Mandates for indoor and outdoor mask-wearing to curb transmission.</li>
        <li>Introduction of a Phased Reopening plan, coupled with rigorous contact tracing and early vaccination
          mandates.</li>
      </ul>

    <article class="scene" data-scene="5">
      <h2>A Closer Look: New York</h2>
      <h3> Hover over a County for more Info! </h3>
      <p>New York quickly emerged as one of the early epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic, garnering national attention
        as hospitals became overwhelmed and medical shortages ensued. In response to this crisis, the governor
        implemented stringent lockdown measures akin to those of Washington, including stay-at-home orders, closure of
        businesses, and intensified social distancing guidelines. Given the high population density, the city
        established field hospitals and enlisted external healthcare aid to manage the surge in cases. The state's
        approach encompassed rigorous lockdown measures, coupled with widespread testing initiatives and a robust
        vaccination campaign, contributing to the containment of the virus spread across the city.</p>
      <p>Some key New York Covid Measures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementation of strict lockdown measures, including stay-at-home orders and business closures.</li>
        <li>Establishment of field hospitals and recruitment of external healthcare aid to cope with the surge in cases.
        </li>
        <li>Aggressive testing efforts and a concerted push for vaccination to mitigate virus transmission.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A Closer Look: Georgia</h2>
      <h3> Hover over a County for more Info! </h3>
      <p> Georgia adopted a relatively relaxed and less stringent approach compared to states such as Washington and New
        York. Instead of implementing stringent lockdown measures, the state pursued an earlier reopening strategy,
        which began in late April 2020. This approach allowed businesses and public gatherings to resume gradually.
        However, the decision to delay the enforcement of a mask mandate until July 2020 was perceived as a factor
        contributing to the increased transmission of the virus and a higher death toll. Despite concerns raised by
        public health experts and community members, Georgia's governor faced scrutiny for the state's approach, which
        some argued was not sufficiently proactive in preventing the escalation of COVID-19 cases and fatalities.
      </p>
      <p>Some Key Georgia Covid Measures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reopening strategy starting in late April 2020, being one of the earliest in the country.</li>
        <li>Delay in enforcing a mask mandate until July 2020, later than many states.</li>
        <li>Criticism directed towards the governor for a perceived lack of proactive measures in controlling COVID-19
          outbreaks.</li>

      <h2>A Closer Look: Florida </h2>
      <h3> Hover over a County for more Info! </h3>
      <p>Florida's policies and actions closely mirrored those of Georgia. They adopted a strategy of early reopening,
        permitting businesses and public spaces to resume operations in May 2020. Similarly, they delayed the
        implementation of a mask mandate until September 2020. The governor encountered significant criticism from those
        who believed that these measures were insufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate the death
        toll.</p>
      <p>Some Key Florida Covid measures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adoption of an early reopening plan, allowing businesses and public spaces to resume operations in May 2020.
        </li>
        <li>Delay in implementing a mask mandate until September 2020.</li>
        <li>Facing criticism for perceived inadequacy of measures in preventing COVID-19 spread and limiting fatalities.

      <h2>Overall Trends and Findings</h2>
      <p> The COVID-19 response strategies employed by Washington, New York, Georgia, and Florida showcased diverse
        approaches, resulting in varied outcomes regarding virus transmission and containment within each state.
        Washington and New York adopted proactive measures early in the pandemic, including prompt declarations of a
        state of emergency, stringent lockdowns, and the enforcement of mask mandates. In contrast, Georgia and Florida
        pursued a less strict approach, opting for earlier reopening and delayed implementation of mask mandates. </p>
      <p> When looking at results of Covid in these states, we can see that Washington has by far the lowest amount of
        cases and depths per capita. This can be directly attributed to the stricter measures that were put in place by
        the governor, helping curb the spread across the state. However, when looking at the other three states we can
        see much higher states. For Florida and Georgia, this makes sense due to the less strict covid regulations and
        early reopening, allowing covid to run rampant across the state. However, we also see a high amount of cases and
        deaths for New York despite having similar Covid regulations as Washington. This reveals that despite the
        implementation of strict governmental measures, high covid rates can be attributed to several other factors that
        we must consider. Some of these factors include high population density and significant levels of international
        travel, as New York's status as an economic and cultural hub may have made it more susceptible to the rapid
        spread of the virus and subsequent high death toll. This high population density and elevated increase in cases
        overwhelm healthcare facilities despite efforts to increase hospital capacity, and may have contributed to
        higher mortality rates.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p> In conclusion, the COVID-19 response strategies of Washington, New York, Georgia, and Florida illustrate the
        varied outcomes stemming from differing governmental approaches. Washington's proactive measures resulted in the
        lowest per capita cases and deaths, contrasting with Georgia and Florida's less strict policies, which led to
        heightened transmission rates. New York's high cases and deaths, despite stringent regulations, highlight the
        complex interplay of factors such as population density and international travel. Moving forward, these findings
        emphasize the importance of tailored and evidence-based interventions in mitigating the impact of pandemics.
